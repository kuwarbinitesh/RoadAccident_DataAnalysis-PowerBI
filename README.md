# Road Accident Data Analysis (2021 - 2022)

## About 

This project utilizes PowerBI to analyze road accident data. The dataset used for analysis is provided in an Excel sheet format. The goal of this project is to visualize and understand patterns, trends, and insights related to road accidents.
A complete, dynamic, insightful and interactive powerBI dashboard is developed from scratch which is operated by few filters and slicers. I've also used the interactive and quick filters as well.

## REQUIREMENT 

Clients want to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have an insight on the below requirements -

    * Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for current year and year on year(YoY) growth
    * Primary KPI's - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth
    * Secondary KPI's -Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year
    * Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year
    * Casualties by Road type for Current Year
    * Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night
    * Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location

## Key Features

> Interactive Dashboards: Visualize accident data through interactive dashboards.
> Geospatial Analysis: Explore accident locations through maps and geographical visualizations.
> Time-Series Trends: Analyze the frequency and patterns of accidents over time.
> Filtering and Slicing: Customize views based on various dimensions like location, time, and severity

## Functionalities I learned and used in this PowerBI Project

> How to connect to raw data/flat files
> Data cleaning in Power Query
> Data Processing
> Time Intelligence Function/Calender Date Table in PowerBI
> Data Modelling (Relationship between multiple tables)
> YTD and YoY Growth Calculations using DAX
> KPI and Advanced KPI Generations
> Creating custom columns and measures in the reports
> Importing Images
> Creating different charts and generating insights

## Why This Project?

Understanding road accidents is crucial for improving road safety measures and saving lives. This project provides a powerful tool for policymakers, researchers, and the general public to comprehend accident data and make informed decisions.
